# 1HGJ#9 Entry

This is an entry for the [1 Hour Game Jam](http://weekjam.com/)  on June 13th 2015. Titled "Teamwork Rocket!"
(guess what the theme was), the game lets two people control a :rocket: on an epic mission! And as a bonus,
they get to argue over who messed up.

Didn't really have time to figure out how Unity 2D physics work, but it's kind of playable. :smile:

## How to play

Keep the :rocket: straight and as close to the middle of the screen as possible. You fall off,you :skull:!

  * **Player 1**: _W_ to :fire:!
  * **Player 2**: _Up_ to :fire:!

Game can be played in :computer: [here](http://www.winterday.net/games/1hrgj/2015/june/13/).
