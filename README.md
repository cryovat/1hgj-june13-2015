# 1HGJ#9 Entry

This is an entry for the [1 Hour Game Jam](http://weekjam.com/)  on June 13th 2015. Titled "Teamwork Rocket!"
(guess what the theme was), the game lets two people control a space rocket on an epic mission.

Didn't really have time to figure out how Unity 2D physics work, but it's kind of playable. :D
